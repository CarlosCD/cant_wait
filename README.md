This Ruby gem allows to add a statement timeout for PostgreSQL databases within a Ruby on Rails application.

From the PostgreSQL documentation:

>     statement_timeout (integer)
> 
>          Abort any statement that takes more than the specified number of milliseconds, starting from the time the command arrives at the server from the client. If log_min_error_statement is set to ERROR or lower, the statement that timed out will also be logged.  A value of zero (the default) turns this off.
> 
>          Setting statement_timeout in postgresql.conf is not recommended because it would affect all sessions.
> 
>     (Â© 1996-2013 The PostgreSQL Global Development Group)

(Visit <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/runtime-config-client.html> for more information)


The gem has been tested with Rails 3.0.3 and above.  Tested also with PostgreSQL 8 and 9, but it may work also in other versions supported by Active Record (see PostgreSQL documentation). See also test/README.md for more details.

If any SQL statement takes more time than the timeout value (measured in milliseconds), its execution will be cancelled, and Active Record would raise a PGError exception.

    ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PGError: ERROR:  canceling statement due to statement timeout
